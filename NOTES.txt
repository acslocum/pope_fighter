INSTALL
 - There is a requirements.txt file at the top of the folder. The way I  
   work on my end is:

   - Create a python virtual environment in the Street_Fighter folder

       python -m venv .venv

   - Enter virtual environment

       source .venv/bin/activate

   - Use pip and requirements.txt to install all the python modules we need

       pip install -r requirements.txt

RUNNING
  - The game is launched via the 'main.py' file in src/
    
      python src/main.py

    At the scan-in screen, you can either scan a QR code (assuming you have a QR code
    scanner), or you can type the Pope ID on the keyboard by typing a '*' and then the
    three digit pope ID. For example, to get Pope Benedict V (pope 144) you would type
      *144

    Gameplay key bindings
      Player 1:
        a - move left
        d - move right 
        r - attack 1
        t - attack 2 

      Player 2:
        left arrow  - move left
        right arrow - move right
        m - attack 1
        n - attack 2

DEBUG mode
  - Near the top of src/main.py (line 38 as of this writing) is the following line:
    
      game_debug = True
    
    I'm using that line to shortcut some of the normal game flow as needed to focus
    on whatever I'm currently working on. At the moment, using that skips the scan-in
    screen, and automatically assigns popes 001 and 002 as players 1 & 2, respectively.
    
    If you comment that line out, then the game will start up showing the scan-in screen
    and your popes will need to be selected via that screen to get to gameplay

Code Layout
  - the two main files to work with are src/main.py and src/fighter.py
    - main.py mostly has the resource loading and game screen sequencing
    - fighter.py takes care of most of the movement/hit/death/etc. mechanics

  - main.py loops (named as they were originally named from original repo)
    - main_menu - this is the scan-in screen for selecting the two popes 
    - game_loop - this is the actual function called to play a game 
    - victory_screen - screen that is shown after a fight ends
    - scores_screen - screen shown after victory_screen (unmodified from original)
